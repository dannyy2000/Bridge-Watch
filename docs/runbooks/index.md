# Bridge Watch Runbook Index

This index is the single entry point for all operational runbooks covering the Bridge Watch platform — a cross-chain asset health monitoring system built on Stellar and Soroban. Runbooks document repeatable procedures so that any on-call engineer can execute critical tasks safely, consistently, and without relying on tribal knowledge.

Runbooks are organized by operational category. Each entry includes a short description and a direct link to the procedure. Keep this index updated whenever a new runbook is added or retired.

## How to Contribute a New Runbook

### Naming Convention

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `short-descriptive-name.md`
- Place the file in `docs/runbooks/`
- Add an entry to this index under the appropriate category before the pull request is merged

### Required Sections

Every runbook must include the following sections, in order:

1. **Purpose and Scope** — what the runbook covers and when to use it
2. **Prerequisites** — access requirements, tools, and prior knowledge needed
3. **Procedure** — numbered steps; each step must be actionable
4. **Verification** — how to confirm the procedure succeeded
5. **Rollback** — how to undo the procedure if it causes a problem
6. **Ownership** — team or role responsible for the runbook
7. **Related Documents** — links to related runbooks, architecture docs, or external references

### Review Process

1. Open a pull request with the new file and the updated index entry.
2. Request a review from the owner of the relevant category (see [Ownership](#ownership)).
3. The reviewer verifies the procedure can be executed by someone unfamiliar with the system.
4. Merge after approval. If the runbook addresses a gap exposed by an incident, link the postmortem issue.

### Keeping Runbooks Current

- Runbooks that become inaccurate after a system change must be updated in the same pull request as the change.
- Runbooks marked `*(pending)*` in this index should be created as GitHub issues and assigned to the category owner.

## Escalation Path

When no runbook covers the current situation, follow this path in order:

1. **Search existing documentation** — check `docs/` for architecture guides, the incident response guide, and the security audit checklist.
2. **Escalate to the category owner** listed in the [Ownership](#ownership) table for the affected subsystem.
3. **Page the Incident Commander** if the event meets SEV-1 or SEV-2 criteria per the [incident response severity matrix](../incident-response-guide.md).
4. **Contact security on-call** immediately if the event involves suspected key compromise, unauthorized contract invocations, or data integrity violations.
5. **Reach out to external parties** if the situation involves a third-party dependency (Circle API, Stellar network, Horizon, Soroban RPC):
   - Stellar Development Foundation status: https://status.stellar.org
   - Circle API status: https://status.circle.com
   - Bridge Watch security contact: security@stellarbridgewatch.io
6. **Document the gap** — after the incident is resolved, open a GitHub issue to create the missing runbook so the gap is not repeated.
